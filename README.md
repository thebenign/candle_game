It's a game

Basically everything is undocumented and uncommented.
80% if this code is recycled from a past project that started as a proof of concept
with no intention of sharing or even using ever again.
Ended up growing into a pretty usable game codebase and now I have to clean it up and
comment it. I'm workin' on it. Fuck off.

There're a couple bugs here and there and a lot of the framework files in /object are
simply not being used right now, so I may or may not get to documenting those.

Most of the modules are pretty straightforward but a few worth peeking at are:

## /object/collidoscope.lua

This is one of my babies. I'll document this in full at some point.
Still a work in progress but it'll do pretty incredible things for huge scale collision detection.

## emitter_class.lua

My favorite little pet project. Simple but powerful particle emitter for all your sparks, fire,
and explosion needs.
